# Introduction

## What is Comsign PWA

**Comsign PWA** is a service for rapid PWA (Progressive Web Apps) creation, specifically designed for affiliate marketing needs.

PWA is a web application that looks and works like a native mobile app but doesn't require publishing to app stores. Users add PWA to their home screen directly from the browser, after which the app works normally — with an icon, splash screen, and push notifications.

The main advantage for affiliates — **no Google Play or App Store moderation required**. You get a ready-to-use app that you can immediately drive traffic to.
