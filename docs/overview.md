## What is Comsign PWA {#what_is_comsign_pwa}

!!! note "Note"
    PWA is a web application that looks and works like a native mobile app but doesn't require publishing to app stores. Users add PWA to their home screen directly from the browser, after which the app works normally — with an icon and push notifications.

Comsign PWA is a service for affiliate marketers that allows you to quickly launch and scale PWA applications *(Progressive Web Apps)* for any funnels without development and unnecessary technical details. We provide a builder and infrastructure for mobile funnels: you create a PWA based on any Google Play app or your own template and content, adapt it to your offer and GEO, connect a domain, and immediately start driving traffic, getting installs and tracking results.

Comsign PWA is suitable for verticals where speed and mobile format matter: Gambling, Betting, Dating, Nutra, Crypto, and others.<br>
The main advantage — **no Google Play or App Store moderation required**. You get a ready-to-use app that you can immediately drive traffic to.
